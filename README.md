# Group_2_Final


## The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection (20 points)

Group two consists of Jessica Cobb, Ranil Basnayake, Zach Otto, and Arya Javidi. The topic we have chosen to analyze is AirBnB data. We plan to use the machine learning model, _____, to predict the prices of AirBnB rentals in different cities based on property type, number of people it can accommodate, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the city in which it is located. The locations that we aim to predict the price of Airbnb listings in are six major cities in US: New York city, Los Angeles,  San Francisco, Washington DC, Chicago, and Boston.


## A description of the data (20 points)

The data we are working with was retrieved from Kaggle from the [following link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rudymizrahi/airbnb-listings-in-major-us-cities-deloitte-ml/).

The data was provided as a part of the Deloitte Machine Learning Competition. The data was provided in CSV format. There are 74,112 rows and 29 columns, which we have reduced to ___ columns after determining which variables would be most pertinent to our machine learning model and analysis.

### The dataset originally contained the following variables: 
* id
* log_price
* property_type
* Room_Type
* Amenities
* Accomodates
* Bathrooms
* Bed_type
* cleaning_fee

* zipcode
* bedrooms
* beds
* Cancellation Policy
* Description
* Host Profile Pic
* Host Response
* Host Since
* First Review
* Last Review
* Name
* thumbnail_url

Of these listed variables, we have decided to use a select few to analyize the dataset and apply the data to our machine learning process.
